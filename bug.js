In React Native, when working with FlatList, an uncommon error can arise when using the `keyExtractor` prop incorrectly.  If the `keyExtractor` function doesn't return a unique key for each item in the data array, FlatList may produce unexpected behavior such as incorrect rendering, item duplication, or incorrect item positioning.  This is especially true if the data array is being updated frequently.  For example, if the data is being fetched from an API and the API response structure is changed, or if items are added or removed frequently, the `keyExtractor` is not updated accordingly. This may cause issues if the keys returned are not unique, thus causing React Native to not correctly update the list efficiently.
